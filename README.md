# 👋 Hey, I'm Gabriel Nomo

**Full-Stack Engineer** specializing in Laravel and Next.js ecosystems, with a growing focus on **Artificial Intelligence integration**.

Currently in my 5th year at **ENSPY** (National Advanced School of Engineering, Yaoundé), I'm bridging the gap between robust web development and intelligent systems to build solutions that truly matter.

---

## 🎯 What I Do

I design and build **full-stack applications** from the ground up — from architecting scalable back-ends to crafting performant user interfaces. My approach is simple: **clean code, tested functionality, and maintainable systems**.

### Current Tech Stack:
- **Back-End:** Laravel , Spring Boot, Django, FastAPI
- **Front-End:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **AI & ML:** Intelligent Agents, Machine Learning, Deep Learning
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **Tools:** Docker, Git, REST APIs, UML, Agile/Scrum

## 🚀 What I'm Building

### 🔹 Production Projects
#### 🔹 Core Projects
- **IMA Platform (ICORP)** — Full-cycle ERP application for competitive exam prep centers (Laravel)
- **AI Tax Assistant (CENADI)** — Intelligent agent for fiscal optimization, integrated into a FastAPI + Next.js stack
- **Pynfi** — Personal finance management app with data visualization (Laravel + Blade)

### 🔹 Learning, Fun & Tutorials
- **[Snake-Game-In-Javascript](https://github.com/NOMO-Gabriel/Snake-Game-In-Javascript)** — A fun project to master core JavaScript concepts.
- **[Learn Laravel Tutorial](https://github.com/NOMO-Gabriel/learn-laravel)** — A public repository to help younger students get started with the Laravel framework.


### 🔹 Community Leadership
As **President of the Computer Engineering Club @[club-genie-informatique-enspy](https://github.com/club-genie-informatique-enspy)** in 2024-2025, I led a team of 24 members, organize workshops (Laravel, React, Spring Boot), and run hackathons to accelerate skill development and professional readiness.

## 🧠 My Engineering Philosophy

> "AI is not a side project — it's the next layer of value I'm adding to software development."

I see **Artificial Intelligence** as an extension of solid engineering principles. My goal is to integrate intelligent systems into production-grade applications, not as experiments, but as reliable, scalable features that solve real problems.
